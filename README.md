# Topic-Modeling
Given description of company we need to categorize it in different classes.

To extract features i have used tf-idf vectoriser as well as word embeddings.

To solve this problem, I have used deep bidirectional lstm neural network. hyperparameter are tried to optimized using bayesian optimization.
I have also used simple bag of words + machine learning classification algorithms
